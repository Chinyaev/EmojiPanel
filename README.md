- :1234: Your frequently used emoji are stored at the top
- :thumbsup: Skin tone modifier and Unicode 9 emojis

## A note on maintainability

The reason I made this package, despite there being quite a few alternatives on the Web Store is - apart from most being full of ads :thumbsdown: - none are open-source and maintainable. If [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) updates with new Unicode emoji entries, you can rely on this extension to include all the emojis your :heart: desires! We can simply run `npm run build` and it creates a new list using [EmojiOne](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione)'s json. :fire:
